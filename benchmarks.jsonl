This mechanism, known as self-attention, enables the model to learn dependencies between distant positions efficiently, as it reduces the number of operations required to relate signals from arbitrary input or output positions to a constant number, unlike other models where it grows with distance.

This mechanism, known as self-attention, enables the model to learn dependencies between distant positions more effectively than previous models, which required a number of operations that grew with the distance between positions. The transformer reduces this to a constant number of operations, although it may reduce effective resolution due to averaging attention-weighted positions.
